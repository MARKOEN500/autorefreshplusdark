# Auto Refresh Plus Dark Version

Auto Refresh Plus Dark Vesrion with some things fixed/removed.
# How to install

**Chrome Web Store**
Go to the [Chrome Web Store](URL to be added soon) and add the extension

**Manually**
Download extension from this page by clicking on green ''Clone or download'' button then click on ''Download ZIP''
Extract files from ZIP to a location where you won't delete extracted folder as deleting it will delete extension from browser later on. I store it on C: drive for now (until I publish it on Chrome Webstore)
From the Chrome/Brave/Opera extensions page, toggle the ''Developer mode'' to ON and then click on 
"Load unpacked extension". From the file dialog, pick the folder where
you've saved the extension folder, then toggle Developer mode to OFF. 
That's it.
